- Rescued from the Goblin Cave by the party
- Now resides in [[Stonehill Inn]]
- A kindhearted human male of nearly fifty years who holds a place of honor in the famous griffon cavalry of the great city of Waterdeep.
- He is an agent of the Lords' Alliance, a group of allied political powers concerned with mutual security and prosperity.
- Sildar met [[Gundren Rockseeker]] in [[Neverwinter]] and agreed to accompany him back to [[Phandalin]].
- Sildar wants to investigate the fate of [[Iarno Albrek]], who disappeared shortly after arriving in Phandalin.
- Sildar hopes to assist [[Gundren Rockseeker]] in reopening the old mine, and help restore Phandalin to a civilized center of wealth and prosperity.
- Sildar provides the characters with useful information:
    - The three Rockseeker brothers (Gundren, Tharden, and Nundro) recently located an entrance to the long-lost [[Wave Echo Cave]], site of the mines of the Phandelver's Pact.
    - [[Klarg]], the bugbear who leads this goblin band, had orders to waylay Gundren. Sildar heard from the goblins that the [[Black Spider]] sent word that the dwarf was to be brought to him. Sildar doesn't know who or what the [[Black Spider]] is.
    - Gundren had a map showing the secret location of [[Wave Echo Cave]], but the goblins took it when they captured him. Sildar believes that [[Klarg]] sent the map and the dwarf to the chief of the Cragmaws at a place called [[Cragmaw Castle]]. Sildar doesn't know where that might be, but he suggests someone in [[Phandalin]] might know.
    - Sildar's contact in Phandalin is a human wizard named [[Iarno Albrek]]. The wizard traveled to the town two months ago to establish order there. After the Lords' Alliance received no word from Iarno, Sildar decided to investigate.
