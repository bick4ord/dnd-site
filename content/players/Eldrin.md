Eldrin Tollbridge - Human Ranger from Waterdeep

Description
---
Eldrin is a lean and agile man in his late twenties, with a wiry frame honed from years of travel and combat. His most striking feature is his heterochromatic eyesâ€”his aiming eye is a piercing green, while the other is a deep brown. His dark brown hair is shoulder-length and often tied back, though it retains an unkempt, rugged look from his time spent in the wilderness. A scar runs diagonally across his left forearm, a reminder of a reckless encounter in his youth. He wears practical, well-worn leather armor embellished with a stoic insignia, reflecting his desire to leave a legacy. His longbow is always within reach, and his quiver of carefully fletched arrows sits comfortably on his back. At his hips, he carries two well-maintained short swords.
