Recap
---
- The party climbed the rubble to the west part of the cave
- The party ambushed an encampment of goblins
- One goblin threatened to kill a human that was held captive
- The party refused to parley, so the human was shoved off of the ledge
- The party healed the human and defeated the goblins
- The human revealed that his name is Sildar, and he offered the party 50gp to escort him back to [[Phandalen]]
- Sildar reveals information:
    - Sildar met Gundren Rockseeker in Neverwinter and agreed to accompany him back to Phandalin. Sildar wants to investigate the fate of Iarno Albrek, a human wizard and fellow member of the Lords' Alliance who disappeared shortly after arriving in Phandalin. Sildar hopes to learn what happened to larno, assist Gundren in reopening the old mine, and help restore Phandalin to a civilized center of wealth and prosperity.
    - Klarg, the bugbear who leads this goblin band, had orders to waylay Gundren. Sildar heard from the goblins that the Black Spider sent word that the dwarf was to be brought to him. Sildar doesn't know who or what the Black Spider is.
- The party moves to the east side of the cave, and are ready to venture into Klarg's lair
