Recap
---
- [[Elmar Barthen]] tasked the players with tracking down goblins that have been raiding caravans and recovering any caravan goods that may have been stashed in their hideout.
	- He provided a rough map acquired from a slain goblin.
	- He let them borrow one of his horse-drawn carts to return any goods.
- [[Qelline Alderleaf]] let the players purchase one of his mules named Rik for 4GP.
	- He will return the gold when the mule is returned.
	- His wife gave the players a sack of vegetables for the journey
- The players killed one goblin guarding the hideout cave entrance.  The other goblin, Chow, surrendered and was taken captive.
- A sentry in the cave saw the torchlight of the players and released a flood into the cave
	- [[Saphrina]] and [[Nayer]] were swept away to the entrance along with Chow, who was tragically killed due to being bound/gagged and in poor health from the battle.
- There are three wolves that are chained in the opening room of the cave, which is now partially flooded
